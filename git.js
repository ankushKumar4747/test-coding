// Introduction to Git and GitHub

// Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes to files over time.
// It is commonly used for coordinating work on projects among multiple people.

// Key Git concepts:
// - Repository: A directory containing your project files, as well as a hidden .git directory that stores the version control information.
// - Commit: A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.
// - Branch: A parallel version of your project.
// - Merge: The process of combining changes from one branch into another.

// GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories.
// It offers features such as:
// - Collaboration: Allows multiple people to work on the same project.
// - Issue tracking: Provides a way to track bugs and feature requests.
// - Pull requests: Enables code review and discussion before merging changes.

// Basic Git workflow:
// 1. Create a repository.
// 2. Make changes to your files.
// 3. Stage the changes (git add).
// 4. Commit the changes (git commit).
// 5. Push the changes to a remote repository (git push).
// 6. Create a pull request to merge changes into the main branch.
